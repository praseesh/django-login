                <p class="card-text">Hindsight is a wonderful thing. When we were mapping out our itinerary and booking accommodation, sailing out to Skellig Michael was an activity high on our list, if not top of our list. To facilitate that we decided to book three nights in Portmagee so we would be really close to where the boat departs from and we booked three nights thinking that if we couldn’t sail on the day we booked for, our first full day in Portmagee, didn’t in Portmagee.  Not ideal.</p>

We traveled by train again, but this time we used a different company. We were able to try out one of the high-speed trains that operates here, Ouigo. They have double decker cars and for a 2 ¾ hour trip it only cost 28 euros (approx. $30) – Why can’t we have train service like this in the US? We really do. </p>

Yes, time flies...imagine, we moved to Bali already in September 2022! I always believe that you should spend a certain time in any place to feel home, and that you reach the best of the experience between the 18th month and 36th month. By that time you've made yourself really home. There is perhaps new discoveries,</p>

There was no rain in the forecast and the temperature was upper 50s. We woke up before 8am, got ready and went up for our usual breakfast. I took a couple of photos of the ship pulling into port, but they didn't turn out that well, because the window was dirty. We both got blueberry pancakes with By 10am and started wandering around.</p>
